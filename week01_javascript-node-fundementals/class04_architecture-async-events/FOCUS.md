Focus and Objective
===

## Practice

We are practicing building node.js programs (libraries and apps):

* managed via `npm` (`package.json`)
    * dependencies
    * scripts
* source control (git)
    * gitignore
* mocha testing
* code in modules exported and imported (required)
    * functions
    * classes

☝️ This is what Monday's quiz will be about

We are practicing correctness, paying attention to detail:

* Syntactically (no errors)
* Semantically (sensible)
* Idiomatically (the way people do it) correct

Tools that help:

* Linting
* Tests
    * Use Watch Mode!

That's why we run these locally **and** on TravisCI

## Diligence and Effort

We want code to be well made. If we were sewing clothes, stitches need to be even.

Be complete as you work:

* No eslint Christmas trees
* Indentation is **perfect**
* Whitespace is **perfectly** consistent
    
**There is no time to do it later**

## Tips

1. Build "muscle memory" through frequent typing
    * Only way to build fluency
1. Don't CopyPasta in class code
    * Running laps, don't take a Lyft
1. Don't use "fix indent" - learn to see blocks of code
1. Limit WIP. Break Problems Down. Laser Focus.
1. Grab a human and go to whiteboard
1. Monitor step size:
    * Difficult or unclear? Take smaller steps
    * Seeming burdensome? Take bigger steps 
1. Inspect error messages carefully!
