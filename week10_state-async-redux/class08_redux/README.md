## Agenda

Build an adventure game. Our final use of `setState` before redux!

## Key Points

### Router

* Use a router, but game will live in one route
* Assumption is that can't "navigate" to place in game
* Could put in "high score" or player list

### Managing State

* The state of the game (what changes over time) store in React `state`
* "Rooms" have can their own logic that we can access along with room data.
