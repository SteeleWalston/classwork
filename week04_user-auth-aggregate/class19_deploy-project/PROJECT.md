Mid-Project Guidelines
===

## Choosing a Project

* Goal is to have a strong server implementation
* Please don't get attached personally to idea of what to build
* Okay to clone an existing web app or thing you have seen

### Process

1. Come up with an idea or couple of ideas
2. Draw high-level picture
3. Find me and I will sign off or give advice what you need to change
4. Have approved idea by 1:00pm tomorrow (Friday)

## Planning

### Application Workflows

* Define the actions the API allows based on user workflows. Should be a value-driven "why"
* A workflow may encompass multiple API calls
    > These are your "user stories"

* What are the connection points to make workflows?
    > Remember: you are not building the "connection" between workflows that an app would normally handle.
* Plan your demo accordingly to simulate
    * Use postman (create a workspace and save queries)
    * You can build:
        * CLI client
        * _Simple_ browser client

### Data Model
* Whiteboard
* models and relationships
    1. Define relationships
    1. Define needed fields
* perfect is the enemy of the good
* different than incomplete or sloppy
* maintain cohesiveness of groups mental model

### Level of understanding
* You are trying to develop shared understanding with an outline of
a basic approach.
* You need greater clarity about the thing are immediately doing then you
do about the next set of related tasks

### Contributor Guidelines
* Single coding style and adhere to it
* Write this out in your README.md as you decide

### Sprint 0

Requirement by Monday afternoon!
1. Planning items complete
1. Everyone can push new code to production (heroku)

## Working as a Group

* Group work
    * We have some goals in a learning environment that are different than a work environment where most everyone has a set of baseline skills.
    * Pairing/mobbing provides better quality consistency, but is slower over the short-term
    * I need to see individual contributions and efforts
* You have a week, product won't be maintained
* Physical distance has impact on communication
* Best for project week:
    * work in parallel and contribute individually
    * yet use each other to get unstuck, discuss, decide, etc.
* All about pace

## How to work

* Prefer doing to talking about (do as you talk)
    * Example: README.md
* Don't speculate when you can get information
* Hypothesize and test
* You **must** pull stress of delivery up into each and everyday, but it will be much smaller stress.
* You do **not** have much time. Beware of to much analysis and discussion at start. You feel like you are making progress, but you are really wasting time. Is further clarity possible, or is it illusory?

### Vertically:

* horizontal === not done
* vertical === done
    > 1 thing 100% done `>` 10 things 10% done
* Focus on "user story" and workflow value
* Okay to split to make working in reduced fashion and then add functionality
    > Example: 1) save films w/o actors, 2) add actors to film save 

### Incrementally

* System moves from one known state to another, each user story adds a bit more functionality.
* Limit WIP (Work in Progress)
* Work on known "User Stories"
* Have a branching strategy and follow it
* You may still need to revisit prior code as domain understanding increases.

Alternative? [Big Ball of Mud]

## Testing

* Supports incremental work
* On a short project has much less value if done test-after
* Goal is to mitigate risk, not to be exhaustive

## Decide

### Choice 1
1. project will be green and incrementally expanded
1. project will be integrated heroically after the fact

If not explicitly choosing and following #1, you are doing #2

### Choice 2
1. Big ball of tangled string - Tell yourself you will clean things up later
1. Organized consistent organization and code - Clean things up as you go.

Choice #1 leads to more difficult to code project, which means you will spend more time tracking down "dumb" errors and you won't have time. 

Choice #2 may feel slower at the start, but finishes strong

End result:
1. Big ball of tangled string
2. Organized project and consistent code
